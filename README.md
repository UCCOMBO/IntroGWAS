# IntroGWAS
Computational workshop teaching principles of complex traits and genome wide association studies using basic python coding notebooks. This workshop contains an introduction on python grammar, python syntax, and data visualization, followed by an introduction on GWAS using simulated genotype and phenotype data. 

By completing this workshop, we expect that students will be able to:
* Perform basic alrithmetic calculations using python. 
* Understand the usefulness of coding variables.
* Explain the importance of functions in programming.
* Interpret data using standard visualization methods.
* Broadly define how p-values are usefull for scientists.
* Interpret GWAS results.
